# Data-Visualisation---Global-Development
The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals data set provides information about a variety of sustainability and developmental metrics for individual countries over the past 20 years. This information is provided by the United Nations in numerical format which makes it difficult for humans to analyse and draw meaning from. By developing a visualisation interface for selected subsections of the available information, we aim to build a system which allows humans to more easily understand, filter, compare and make use of the available information.
